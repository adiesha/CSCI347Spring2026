## Prerequisites:
Students are expected to have taken the following courses, namely STAT 216Q or STAT 332 or EGEN 350, and CSCI 232. Basic working experience in python is expected. An introductory linear algebra course is recommended as it would enhance the students' understanding of the fundamental methods and algorithms, data mining techniques, tools, and packages. 

## Communication tools:
The course is delivered in person. Attendance is required and highly recommended. If you miss substantial amounts of lectures, you might find it hard to understand concepts taught in the class. 
-	Course content and assignments will be posted on Canvas.
-	Assignments should be submitted to Canvas.
-	Announcements will be posted on Canvas and Discord server. Students can use discord server to ask questions and find partners for the group projects. 

## Course description
### Basic description:
Introduction to data acquisition and pre-processing, common data formats, graph models, itemset mining, clustering, dimensionality reduction, classification, and advanced topics for knowledge discovery from large-scale data sets, with a focus on applications to real-world data sets.

The efficient analysis of large-scale, complex, rapidly changing data sets is a necessity in today’s big data requirements. We need new algorithms that can provide sensible solutions to problems that are large, evolving, incomplete and computationally hard. This need for computationally efficient algorithms sparked development of new fields of data science, data mining and machine learning which combines ideas from computer science, statistics, linear algebra, and other related fields. This course will help you to understand popular technique, algorithms, and tools available for the analysis of real-world data sets. We will build and learn these techniques on top of your existing mathematical and computation fundamentals like statistics, linear algebra, data structures and algorithms. Students will learn common approaches to knowledge extraction from data. Some techniques will be covered in detail, but the goal of this course is to introduce students to overview of broad range of tools and techniques available to data analysis. Students will be given opportunities to practice applying data science concepts to real-world data, as well as interpreting and presenting the results of their analysis. 

## Learning outcomes:

Students will learn how and when to use the common data mining and statistical learning methods, understand their comparative strengths and weaknesses, and how to evaluate their performance. Students completing this course should be able to:

-	Construct and apply statistical methods for predicting modeling.
-	Use unsupervised learning methods to find structure in data.
-	Incorporate appropriate techniques to detect patterns and anomalies in complex data.
-	Properly select, tune, and evaluate models.

|                                 Attendance                                	|                     6                     	|
|                                 Assignment                                	|                     30                    	|
|                                Mini Projects                               	|                     24                    	|
|                                Mid-term exam                              	|                     10                    	|
|                                Final project                              	|                     20                    	|

|                                     Sum                                   	|               100 + (up to 2)             	|

After any curving (I will decide whether this is applicable for this class or not), your grade will be determined by your total score as follows:
93+: A; 90+: A-; 87+: B+; 83+: B; 80+: B-; 77+: C+; 73+: C; 70+: C-; 67+: D+; 63: D; 60: D-.

## Quizzes
There will be short quizzes posted after each topic or week (sometimes you will get two quizzes per week). There are no make up opportunities for these quizzes. These quizzes are short, and you should be able to finish them under 10-15 minutes if you have gone through the lecture material. I will drop the lowest quiz from your overall grade. If you complete these quizzes right after each class, it should be very easy to get the full grade for quizzes.

## Attendance
We will be using iClicker to track attendance. You are required to create an iClicker account if you do not already have one. Please use the following resource for instructions on how to create your account: https://ato.montana.edu/iclicker/

You may use either your mobile device XOR laptop to record attendance through the iClicker app (Once you pick a device you must stick to it as iClicker will not allow you to use multiple device). I will be using the iClicker proximity feature, so the device you use must have location services enabled. You must use the same device for attendance throughout the semester, as switching devices can cause issues with iClicker.

Please do not wait until the middle of the semester to set up your account — I will NOT manually enter attendance if your account is not active. However, if you forget to record you attendance during the class time, but remembered right after the class, you may ask me to manually enter the attendance.

Attendance in iClicker will automatically open during class meetings, and it is your responsibility to record your attendance through the app. Occasionally, attendance may activate on holidays that fall on a scheduled class day; if that happens, I will remove those entries manually, so there is no need to worry.
On test days, you do not need to use iClicker for attendance.


## Assignments 
There will be a written assignment every other week. All assignments must be completed individually and submitted Canvas. Students are encouraged to ask questions about homework-related questions through Discord. **5% will be deducted for each day of delay after the due date. **

## Mini Projects
There will be 3 mini-projects. For each of the project you must write a report and submit it along with your code. The mini projects should be completed in teams of 3-4 members. Every team member is expected to contribute substantially to any group project. The distribution of the work is up to the team. Each report should have a section that shows the breakdown of the distribution of work among the team members. 5% of the points will be deducted for each day of delay after the due date. 

## Exam
There will be one in-class mid-term exam in this course. I will announce the exact exam dates later. If you need accommodations, please let me know before the exam.

## Collaboration
Collaboration is encouraged. However, all submitted work must be individual work (except the group project). If you got help from others, please acknowledge your collaborators at the beginning of the submission.
For any group projects, every team member is expected to contribute substantially to the submission. However, the distribution of the work is up to the group. 
For assignments, You may
- Work with anyone in the course.
- Share ideas with others.
- Help others to debug their codes.

You may not:
- Submit homework, code, or proof that you did not write.
- You may not claim others work as your own and submit it.
  
If you decide to use external resources, be sure to properly cite them. If you decide to paraphrase someone else’s work, make sure that you cite the appropriate work. 
By participating in this course, you agree to abide by the student's code of conduct. Please review the code of student conduct. https://www.montana.edu/policy/student_conduct/.

## Classroom Etiquette
- Please note that, disruptive behavior during the class time will not be tolerated and will result in such disruptive students being asked to leave the lectures.
- Please be kind and respectful to other students in the class.
- I will add more requirements here if it deems appropriate.

## Special needs and accommodations
If you have a documented disability and need or might need any accommodation, please reach out to the Office of Disability Services as soon as possible. They will instruct you on what you need to do to get accommodation for this class. 

## Course survey and evaluation
If 60% of the students complete the course survey and evaluation, all the students will get some bonus points. (I will decide the exact value of the bonus points, you can expect it to be between 0.25—0.75).
